**<h2>Revenue by Item</h2>**

We can observe that Sandwich generated the highest revenue, earning approximately £5k more than the second-highest item, while cookie generated the lowest revenue.

**<h2>Top 3 Selling Items</h2>**

Month by month, Sandwich is usually the most purchased item, with sales peaking in June as summer begins. Sales dip in September, likely due to the arrival of Autumn, but overall, this pattern indicates that people are health conscious. Juices and salads are also among the top selling items, further supporting the trend of health conscious consumer choices. This aligns with the fact that the highest revenue-generating items are sandwiches, juices and salads.

**<h2>Monthly Revenue</h2>**

The monthly revenue consistently falls between £6.5k and £7.5k, with February being the lowest revenue month. After the festive season in December and the New Year, people tend to tighten their budgets, hence this could result in fewer visits to cafes in February. A promotion could be a good strategy to boost revenue during February, such as Valentine's-themed specials. October and June are the highest revenue months, suggesting that as the weather cools, people are more inclined to enjoy warm drinks.

**<h2>Distribution of Total Spent across Payment Method</h2>**

Credit card, cash, and digital wallet appear to be used equally as payment methods, regardless of the total amount spent. There is no evident pattern indicating that any particular payment method is more commonly used for larger payments. For instance, when the total spent is £20, digital wallet is the most common payment method. However, when the total spent reaches £25, both digital wallet and cash are used less frequently than credit card. Total spent may correlate with payment method for specific customer segments, such as demographics but not at a general level.
